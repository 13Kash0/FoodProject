Boil a pot of water until it is boiling
Next, take the Spahgetti out of the packaging and put into the pot
The pasta should take about 10-15 minutes but drain the water out of the pasta when the pasta is soft to your liking
take your vegtables and our them into a seprate pan with spices of your choice and a little bit of water.
Once the vegtables are cooked set them aside
Take the pasta Sauce and pour into the pot of strained Spahgetti
make sure you add the vegtables as well.
gently fold the Sauce into the pasta so it doesnt break the Spahgetti
Take a plate and pour your Spahgetti onto it
THESE NEXT STEPS ARE optional
Add a little bit of mozzarella cheese and cilantro for presentaion
Enjoy!
